Simple data manager for nested data, dot notation access, extendability, and container interoperability.

This project began as a three part tutorial series which can be found at http://phoenixlabstech.org/2015/04/17/building-a-data-manager/

## Goals
  * Light weight
  * Fluent, simple, clear API
  * Manage any data type (closure, object, primitives, etc.)
  * Manage nested data via dot-notation
  * Manage nested data via magic methods ($manager->one()->two()->three)
  * Be composable - integrate into current containers via traits
  * Be extensible.
  * Allow for protected data (immutable)
  * Test coverage, PSR compliant, [container interoperability](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop), and best practices

## Extras
On top of being a powerful data-manager, there are traits that add features.
They are not documented here, but see other readmes for:
  * [IoC Container](ioc.md): Use Manager as a simple but powerful Dependency Injection Container. Includes
    * Resolving dependencies from classnames, closures, eager loading, and more,
    * Creating singletons,
    * Configuring dependencies for dependencies,
    * Fallbacks, preparing objects, and more.
  * Use Manager as a configuration bank, complete with defaults.
  * Collections for extra array-helper methods (based on [Arrayzy](https://github.com/bocharsky-bw/Arrayzy))
    
## Install
Via Composer
``` bash
$ composer require michaels/data-manager
```

## Upgrading
Note that between 0.8.2 and 0.8.3, the `__constuct()` method was removed from `ManagesItemsTrait`. If you are using that trait directly, you should implement your own. 

See `Michaels\Manager\Manager` for an example.

## Getting Started
Manager does exactly what you would expect: it *manages* complex items such as config data, arrays, and closures.
The best way to get started is simply instantiate `Michaels\Manager\Mangaer`

```php
$manager = new Michaels\Manager\Manager([
    'some' => [
        'starting' => [
            'data' => 'here (optional)'
        ]
    ]
]);
// Note, you may initialize Manager with an array or any instance of Traversable (like Manager itself)

/* Basic Usage. All works with dot notation as well */
$manager->add('name', 'value');
$manager->add('some.nested.data', 3); // Use dot notation for namespacing or nesting
$manager->get('name'); // 'value'
$manager->get('doesntexist', 'fallback'); // 'fallback'
$manager->get('doesntexist') // throws an ItemNotFoundException with no fallback
$manager->getIfHas('doesntexist') // returns a NoItemFoundMessage instead of a script-stopping exception
$manager->getAll(); // returns array of all items
$manager->all(); // returns array of all items
$manager->exists('name'); // true
$manager->exists('some.starting.data'); // true
$manager->exists('nope'); // false
$manager->has('something'); // alias of exist
$manager->set('name', 'new-value'); // updates item
$manager->remove('some.starting.data');
$manager->isEmpty(); // true or false
$manager->toJson(); // returns json of all items
echo $manager; // returns json string of all items
$manager->reset($array); // rebuild with new items
$manager->clear(); // empty the manager
$manager->hydrateFrom('json', $data); // imports from serialized data into new data set - currently only JSON
$manager->appendFrom('json', $data); // same as hydrate, but adds data to current data set

/* You can also use $manager as an array or in loops */
$manager['some']['starting']['data']; // 'here (optional)'
//etc

foreach ($manager as $item => $value) {
    // do whatever your heart desires
}

/* Finally, you may manage values using magic methods */
$manager->some()->starting()->data; // 'here (optional)'
$manager->some()->item = 'item'; // sets some.item = 'item'
$manager->some()->item()->drop(); // deletes some.item

// Note that levels are called as a method with no params. The data is then called, updated, or set as a property.
```

## Protecting Data
You can also guard any item or nest from being changed. Simply,
```php
$manager->protect('some.data'); //now some.data and everything under it cannot be altered
$manager->set('some.data.here', 'new-value'); // throws an exception
```

## Merging Defaults Into Current Dataset
When using Manager to store configuration data, it is important to be able to set defaults.
You can merge an array of defaults into manager via `loadDefaults(array $defaults)`

Imagine your configuration starts like
```php
$manager = new Manager([
    'name' => 'My Awesome App',
    'site' => [
        'url' => 'http://youwishyouwerethiscool.com/',
        'assets' => '/static'
    ]
]);
```

But your app needs `site.title` and `author`. Simply
```php
$manager->loadDefaults([
    'site' => [
        'url' => 'http://the_default_url.com/',
        'protocol' => "https",
        'assets' => '/assets',
    ],
    'database' => "mysql"
]);
```

And now, your configuration looks like
```php
    'name' => 'My Awesome App',
    'site' => [
        'url' => 'http://youwishyouwerethiscool.com/'
        'protocol' => "https",
        'assets' => '/static' // NOT the default /assets
    ],
    'database' => "mysql"
```

A couple of things to keep in mind:
  * This works recursively and as far down as you want.
  * If any value is set before loading defaults, that value is preserved
  * If a starting value is set to an array (`one.two = []`) and a default lives beneath (`one.two.three = default`), then the default **will** be set.
  * On the other hand, if the value exists and is **not** an array, the default will be ignored. 
  (`one.two = 'something'`) In this case, there is no `one.two.three`, even after loading defaults.

## Collections
Right now, you may choose to return a `MutableArray` which comes with a lot of helpers.
Simply include `Michaels\Manager\Traits\CollectionTrait` into your class. By default, `get()` and `getAll()` will return collections.
These collections behave *identically* to arrays, but come with extra methods. See [Arrayzy](https://github.com/bocharsky-bw/Arrayzy) for a full api.

It is possible to chain things for brevity:
```php
$value = $manager->get('one.two.three')->walk(function(){});
```
In this case, `walk()` is part of the collection and will apply the callback to each value, then return the updated contents.

## Using Manager Traits
If you have your own container objects and want to add Manager functionality to them, you may import traits into your class.

There are 3 Traits that make up Manager:
  1. `ManagesItemsTrait` fulfills `ManagesItemsInterface` and adds most functionality. Look at the interface for full list.
  2. `ArrayableTrait` makes the class usable as an array (`$manager['some']['data']`) or in loops and such
  3. `ChainsNestedItemsTrait` allows you to use fluent properties to manage data (`$manager->one()->two()->three = 'three`)

*NOTE THAT* all traits depend on ManagesItemsTrait. If you try to use ChainsNestedItemsTrait or ArrayableTrait without ManagesItemsTrait, you will get all sorts of errors.

```php
class MyContainer {
    use Michaels\Manager\Traits\ManagesItemsTrait; // for all the basic functionality
    use Michaels\Manager\Traits\ChainsNestedItemsTrait; // to access nested items via magic methods
    use Michaels\Manager\Traits\ArrayableTrait; // So you can use $myConainer like an array
    
    // Your stuff here. And you may override anything you like
}
```

If you do use a trait, and want to initialize your class at construction, use the `initManager()` method.

```php
class MyClass
{
    use ManagesItemsTrait;
    
    public function __construct($beginningItems)
    {
        $this->initManager($beginningItems);
    }
}

```

initManager() is used so it doesn't conflict with user-defined init() methods.

#### Two important notes
  1. Using `ManagesItemsTrait` does not implement ArrayAccess, so you can't use your manager as an array (`$manager['one']`). Use `ArrayableTrait` for that.
  2. `ManagesItemsTrait` no longer includes a constructor. It is just best not to include constructors in traits. It is recommended (though not necessary) to use a constructor in your class:
```php
public function __construct($items = [])
{
    $this->initManager($items);
}
```

You may also use the **tests** under `tests/traits` to test your integrated functionality. You may have to grab these through cloning the repo. composer usually won't include tests in your `require`

## Some Advanced Features
By default, Manager stores all the items in an `$items` property. 
If you are using the `ManagesItemsTrait` and want to use an internal property besides `$items` to avoid collisions, you have two options:

  1. Use `$manager->setItemsName($nameOfProperty)` either in your constructor or before you add anything
  2. Set the `$dataItemsName` property to a string of the new property name. Then be sure to call `initManager()` in your constructor.

## Exceptions
If you try to `get()` an item that doesn't exist, and there is no fallback, an `ItemNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If you do not want an exception, use `getIfHas($alias)` which will return a `NoItemFoundMessage` object, or use a fallback value `get($item, $fallback)`.

If you try to nest under an existing value that is not an array, an `NestingUnderNonArrayException` will be thrown.
```php
$manager = new Manager(['one' => 1]);
$manager->add("one.two", "two-value"); // exception
```

If you try to alter a protected item, a `ModifyingProtectedItemException` will be thrown.

## Interoperability
Data Manager is [PSR compliant](http://www.php-fig.org/) and [Container Interoperability](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) compliant. Any oversights, please let me know.

## Testing
We try for at least 80% test coverage.
``` bash
$ phpunit
```

You may also use the **tests** under `tests/traits` to test your integrated functionality. You may have to grab these through cloning the repo. composer usually won't include tests in your `require`
